# 🐶 Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs (Transfer Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **image classification using Transfer Learning** with the **MobileNetV2** deep learning model pre-trained on ImageNet. The model is trained to classify images of cats and dogs, making use of **data augmentation, feature extraction, and GPU acceleration** in Google Colab.

## 🧠 Approach
- Used **MobileNetV2** as the base model for Transfer Learning
- Fine-tuned dense layers for binary classification
- Applied **data augmentation** to improve generalization
- Trained using **Google Colab GPU support**
- Evaluated using training & validation accuracy

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- High training accuracy (~97%)
- Efficient model training with frozen base layers
- Real-world Deep Learning workflow implementation
- Supports scalability for other image datasets
